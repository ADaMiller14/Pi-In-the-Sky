# Pi In the Sky
## Equations
Everyone needs some equations to define various bits 'n pieces. Here are ours:

(number of balloons) = 81.7 * (mass in kilograms)

(ft<sup>3</sup> of helium) = 33 * (mass in kilograms)

### January
_Day 1 through Day 12_

__January 9 - Day 1__

We began the project early. Because of this, we deviated slightly from the schedule by planning out the size (and ground floor shape) of the house.

__January 10 - Day 2__

We mostly finished the floor plan and decided against including a camera. We also began to mass the necessary components.

__January 13 - Day 3__

We finished the ground floor and began to work on the top floor.

__January 14 - Day 4__

We began to create the actual building (walls, etc.).

__January 16 - Day 5__

We finished the ground floor and began the second floor.

__January 17 - Day 6__

We had a half day, so we weren't able to make much progress on the project.

__January 22 - Day 7__

We finished the second floor and chimney, and began making the roof.

__January 23 - Day 8__

We continued making the roof and began working on the walls for the second story.

__January 24 - Day 9__

We made half of the roof and are a mere five or so parts away from completion of the house.

__January 27 - Day 10__

We finished creating the acual architecture of the house, and have moved on to the code.

__January 28 - Day 11__

We figured out how to control a servo with the Pi, and we began to take the steps necessary to save inputs (the accelerometer data) to a .txt file.

__January 30 - Day 12__

Aidan discovered how to read and write a .txt file, as well as how to save it. He began making test code that would simply write accelerometer data to a .txt file.

### Febuary
_Day 13 through Day --_

__Febuary 3 - Day 13__

Aidan almost finished the test .txt writer.

__Febuary 4 - Day 4__

We finished the writer, and began to learn how to use the altimeter.
