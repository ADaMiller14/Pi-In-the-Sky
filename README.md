### January
_Day 1 through Day --_

__January 9 - Day 1__

We began the project early. Because of this, we deviated slightly from the schedule by planning out the size (and ground floor shape) of the house.

__January 10 - Day 2__

We mostly finished the floor plan and decided against including a camera. We also began to mass the necessary components.

__January 13 - Day 3__

We finished the ground floor and began to work on the top floor.
